    "#### 1. Basic class and object\n",
    "Create a car class with attribute like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __init__ is kind of constructor. When any object or instance is declared of a class, init method is called.\n",
    "This is special key word in which you can pass arguments in Class. \n",
    "Object when created this method is called, this constructor method. \n",
    "\n",
    "- self is keyword to establish link or context of variables in class with the class itself. When refer to class's\n",
    "own attributes we will use self keyword. Like telephone line, when creating a method, if want to use class's attribute inside the method self needs to be passed as well. Who is trying to access the class variables, \"which object ?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Class Method and Self\n",
    "Add method to the Car class that displays the full name of the car (brand and model)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Inhertence\n",
    "Create an Electric Car class that inherits from Car class and has an additional attribute battery_size.\n",
    "Just pass class as argument\n",
    "super() used to access above class methods, we here access __init__ method of previous class, and pass constructor arguments in that, so we don't need to assign them again, as parent class has already done that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Enscapsulation\n",
    "Modify Car class to encapsulate the brand attribute, making it private, and provide a getter method for it.\n",
    "We will decide what to provide access to and not to. No direct access. Hide details. \n",
    "__variables -> are private variables, cannot be accessed directly outside the class. Error -> no such attribute. Object cannnot access it. \n",
    "We can make a getter method to allow variable to be accessed by object via method. use get_ in method name convention\n",
    "Try using setter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Polymorphism\n",
    "Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a method fuel_type in both car and electricar classes, but with different behaviours.\n",
    "overloading methods basically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Class Variables\n",
    "Add a class variable to Car that keeps track of the number of cars created. Object or Instance count.\n",
    "use class name and access variable directly. Car.total_car.\n",
    "Can declare car without storing instance, it is availabe only in that line\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Static Method\n",
    "Add a static method to the Car class that returns a general description of a car.\n",
    "A method that belongs to the Class rather than the instance of the object. \n",
    "Will always have to use Class.method to call the static method, instead of object.method.\n",
    "Just don't pass self in and put @staticmethod in decorator. Decorator enhance python functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Property decorator \n",
    "Use a property decorator in the car class to make the model attribute read-only.\n",
    " @property above a method, this will access method like a property. Now you won't be able to override this method as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Class Inheritence and isinstance() Function\n",
    "Demonstrate the use of isinstance() to check if my_tesla is an instance of  Car and ElectricCar\n",
    "isinstance(object, Class) -> gives true and false\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Multiple Inheritence \n",
    "Create two classes, Batter and Engine, and let ElectricClass inherit from both. Demonstrate multiple inheritence.\n",
